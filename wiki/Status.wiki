#summary status of the various elements of the SDK

==IMPORTANT==
There are two main versions of IVEF around, the first is IVEF 0.1.x which was the original exchange format which has been implemented by a number of parties and is in operational use. 

The second version is the draft definition as it is being developed by the [IVEFWorkingGroup]. This version is designated with 0.2.x. Once this definition has become sufficiently stable, the IVEF SDK will start to support it. 

Until that time, small enhancements may be made to the 0.1 branch to approach the 0.2 version more closely, allowing for a more smooth transition from 0.1 to 0.2.

==Versions==
The table below shows the versions of separate components and the version of the entire SDK as encapsulating item. Note that the definition was recoded from 1.1 to 0.1.1 for consistency reasons (three digit coding) so IVEF_DEF 1.1 is equal to 0.1.1

|| *IVEF_SDK*                       || 0.1.0    || 0.1.1 || 0.1.2 || 0.1.3 ||
