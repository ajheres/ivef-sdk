#summary status of the various elements of the SDK

==Versions==

The table below shows the versions of separate components and the version of the entire SDK as encapsulating item. Note that the definition was recoded from 1.1 to 0.1.1 for consistency reasons (three digit coding) so IVEF_DEF 1.1 is equal to 0.1.1
