#summary What's in the package

The IVEF SDK consists of various modules and example programs. 

==Layering==


http://ivef-sdk.googlecode.com/files/layers.png

==Documentation==
In the documentation section you can find the XSD schemes that define the interface. The XSD is also available as a pdf [http://ivef-sdk.googlecode.com/files/ivef1.pdf document]

We use a version number based on *major.minor.path* patch releases fix only bugs, minor releases are compatible with minor effort, major releases contain complete overhauls. We have created a page with [Usefull SVN Commands]

==IVEF Library==
Available in various programming [languages] and for various platforms

|| OS / Language || Qt || Obj-C || C# || Java ||
|| Linux 64 bits    ||  verified  ||  no  || ? || verified ||
|| Mac OS X 10.5  || verified  || verified || no || not tested yet ||
|| Windows XP || verified || no || ? || not tested yet ||


See the [Developing] page on how the library works and how you should interface with it.

==Tools ==
===xsd2code===
The core of the SDK is generated by the xsd2code tool. This is a generic tool but developed and tuned especially for the IVEF format. It takes the XSD specification as input and generates classes that hold and verify the information as specified by the IVEF format. It also includes a XML generator in each class and and a generic parser that can parse XML and notify the user of new IVEF messages (based on the generated classes) (Read  [http://code.google.com/p/ivef-sdk/wiki/Building here] how to build the software)

The generated classes are half of the story. You will still need to obey the sequence of sending and receiving messages. That's why we have created some sample software that shows basic handling of the sequences of both the server and the receiver.

===tests===
The library comes with a simple automated [Test] enviroment which is used to test if the library performs as it should. The [Test] framework is available for the Qt version of the library, but can easily be ported to the other libaries as well.

=== astyle===
Coding style is enforced with the help of *astyle --style=kr*

==Examples==
===iListen===
iListen is short for "IVEF Listener". This is a simple example of a user program for connecting and obtaining data from an IVEF source. iListen also makes an excellent test tool.

You can check out the [http://code.google.com/p/ivef-sdk/wiki/Developer Developer] page on how to [http://code.google.com/p/ivef-sdk/wiki/Building Build] the software or its [http://code.google.com/p/ivef-sdk/wiki/Usage Usage] or [http://code.google.com/p/ivef-sdk/downloads/list download] a pre-compiled executable. Current status is beta.

===ivef2kml===
An example that can connect to an IVEF source, similar as iListen, and convert incomming data to Google's KML format. The format is offered as a webservice, which allows applications as Google Earth and Google Maps to connect directy to a IVEF source.

=== iSim===
A ship simulator that generates objects (randomly) and outputs them in the IVEF format. This is designed as a coding example of the server side, but also serves as an excellent test tool. (Currently in alpha)
