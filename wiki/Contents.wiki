See the [Developing] page on how the library works and how you should interface with it.

==xsd2code==
The core of the SDK is generated by the xsd2code tool. This is a generic tool but developed and tuned especially for the IVEF format. It takes the XSD specification as input and generates classes that hold and verify the information as specified by the IVEF format. It also includes a XML generator in each class and and a generic parser that can parse XML and notify the user of new IVEF messages (based on the generated classes) (Read  [http://code.google.com/p/ivef-sdk/wiki/Building here] how to build the software)

The generated classes are half of the story. You will still need to obey the sequence of sending and receiving messages. That's why we have created some sample software that shows basic handling of the sequences of both the server and the receiver.

==iListen==
iListen is short for "IVEF Listener". This is a simple example of a user program for connecting and obtaining data from an IVEF source. iListen also makes an excellent test tool.

You can check out the [http://code.google.com/p/ivef-sdk/wiki/Developer Developer] page on how to [http://code.google.com/p/ivef-sdk/wiki/Building Build] the software or its [http://code.google.com/p/ivef-sdk/wiki/Usage Usage] or [http://code.google.com/p/ivef-sdk/downloads/list download] a pre-compiled executable. Current status is beta.

== iSim ==
A ship simulator that generates objects (randomly) and outputs them in the IVEF format. This is designed as a coding example of the server side, but also serves as an excellent test tool. (Currently in alpha)
