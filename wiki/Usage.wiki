#summary How to use iListen

= Connecting to a server =
In order to connect to an IVEF server, simply type:

{{{
 Gregorius:iListen aqua$ ./iListen --host=ivef.hitt.nl --port=8043 --user=guest --password=jamesbond
}}}
which would initiate a connection to host ivef.hitt.nl on port 8043. The application will attempt a user login based on the username and password provided. If all goes well, the server will send an login reply, followed by a stream of track data which will be decoded by iListen, and displayed on standard out.
