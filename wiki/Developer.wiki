= Breakdown =
When browsing the src dir of iListen you will find the following classes:

 * CmdLineOption
 * IVEFFileHandler
 * IVEFHandler
 * IVEFStreamHandler
 * iListenApplication
 * main

=Setup=
In the *main* class you will only find a call to setup a Qt Application. This *iListenApplication* sets up most variables and handles the command line options you have provided with the help of the *CmdLineOption* class.

=Parsing=
The actual parsing is done in *IVEFHandler* This class parses the XML stream and tries to generate sensible output. It is used by both the *IVEFStreamHandler* and *IVEFFileHandler* which feed it with either a tcp stream of data or with a file stream of data.

=Coding style=
Kernighan & Ritchie style formatting/indenting is used, and ensured by running *astyle --style=kr*

=Building=
There's an entire page devoted to [http://code.google.com/p/ivef-sdk/wiki/Building building] the software
